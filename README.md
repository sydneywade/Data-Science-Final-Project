## **Data Science Final Project**
### **Project Overview**
This repository contains the final project from my Data Science course at Tulane University done in Jupyter notebooks. The goal of the project is to use skills and concepts learned in the data science course to examine variables associated with areas of high short-term rental property density in New Orleans and predict the likelihood of a short-term rental property being in lose proximity to grocery stores or bars.

### **Key Features**
- Data: the primary dataset comes from the City of New Orleans Open Data portal (data.nola.gov) and contains information about short-term rental permit requests and the property status
- Data preprocessing: the project shows how data is cleaned and transformed to make data more accessible for predictive modeling
- Predictive analysis: the project focuses on predictive modeling to determine the proximity of a short-term rental property to a grocery store or bar

### **Repository Contents**
This repository contains the final project as well as two other milestones that showcase our thought process and how the semester-long project was organized.

### **Prerequisites**
- Jupyter notebooks
- Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

### **Getting Started**
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/sydneywade/Data-Science-Final-Project.git
```
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Open the Jupyter notebook

### **Acknowledgments**
The project was done by me and my partner, Olivia Meyer. We received help from our instructor, Saad Hassan.
